# Cat Creator Refactor

Currently, the cat creator form is one vertically tall form. To immprove the experiece, we need to show the form sections. In effect, this is a cat cration wizard. Each form section should be another step along the path.

The cat preview should always appear on the left, regardless of what step the wizard is on.

## Wizard steps

1. Basic info
2. Appearance. We should include size in this step too.
3. Personality
4. Behavior

## Form controls

For each step, there should be contextualized buttons:

1. A `next` button
2. A `previous` and `next` button
3. A `previous` and `next` button
4. A `previous` and `create` button

Under the preview should be a `reset` button
