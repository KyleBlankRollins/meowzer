## How it works

The demo above uses a real Meowbase instance running in your browser. All operations are performed in-memory, so your data will reset when you refresh the page.

### Creating cats

Use the form to add new cats with a name, age, and color.

### Reading cats

All cats in the collection are displayed in the list below the form.

### Updating cats

Click the "Edit" button on any cat to update their information.

### Deleting cats

Click the "Delete" button to remove a cat from the collection.
