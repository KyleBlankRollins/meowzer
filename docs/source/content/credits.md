description: Technology stack and acknowledgments for the Meowbase documentation site

## Tech Stack

This documentation site was built with the following technologies:

- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** (v7.1.14) - Fast build tool and dev server
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** (~5.9.3) - Type-safe JavaScript
- **[Lit](https://lit.dev/)** - Web components and HTML templating
- **[Quiet UI](https://quietui.com/)** - Lightweight web component library
- **[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)** - Markdown parser
- **[gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)** - YAML frontmatter parsing

## Custom Static Site Generator

Rather than using an off-the-shelf solution, we built a custom static site generator as a Vite plugin. This gives us complete control over the documentation experience while keeping the codebase minimal and tailored to Meowbase's needs.

## Built with AI

This documentation site and the custom SSG were developed with assistance from **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic), demonstrating how modern AI tools can help create sophisticated web applications while maintaining clean, readable code.
