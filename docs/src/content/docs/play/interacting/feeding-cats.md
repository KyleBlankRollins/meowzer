---

One of the most delightful interactions with Meowzer cats is feeding them! Cats need food and water, and they'll show their appreciation when you provide it.

## How Feeding Works

### The Basics

When you place food on a page with cats:

1. **Food appears** at the spot you clicked or selected
2. **Nearby cats notice** the food (if they're paying attention)
3. **Hungry cats approach** to investigate
4. **Cats eat the food** and it disappears
5. **Cats become satisfied** and may rest or continue exploring

### What You'll See

**Before feeding:**

- Cats wandering normally
- No particular direction or goal

**After placing food:**

- Cats within range turn toward it
- Hungry cats walk over
- Cat reaches food and pauses
- Food disappears (consumed!)
- Cat continues on their way

## Types of Food

### Basic Food (Kibble) 🥘

**What it is:**

- Standard dry cat food
- Simple but satisfying
- Most common option

**How cats react:**

- Will eat when hungry
- Provides basic satisfaction
- Good for regular feeding

**When to use it:**

- Regular feeding
- Multiple cats to feed
- Budget-conscious feeding 😉

### Fancy Food (Wet Food) 🍖

**What it is:**

- Premium wet cat food
- Very satisfying
- Cats love it!

**How cats react:**

- Highly attractive to cats
- Provides extra satisfaction
- Preferred over basic food
- Cats may prioritize it

**When to use it:**

- Treating a favorite cat
- Special occasions
- When you want cats to respond quickly
- Maximum satisfaction

## Placing Food

### How to Place Food

The method depends on the website you're visiting:

**Common interactions:**

- **Click buttons** - "Feed Cat" or "Place Food" buttons
- **Click on page** - Some sites let you click anywhere to place food
- **Dropdown menus** - Select food type then click location
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Some sites support hotkeys

**Check the website's instructions** - each site may have different controls!

### Good Placement Strategy

**Near cats:**

- Place food close to cats for quick response
- Cats detect food within a certain radius
- Closer = faster response

**Open areas:**

- Place in areas cats can reach
- Avoid corners where cats rarely go
- Central locations work well

**Multiple food items:**

- Spread them out for multiple cats
- Create a feeding station in one area
- Mix basic and fancy food

**Avoid:**

- Placing food outside cat boundaries
- Stacking too much in one spot
- Areas cats never visit

## Water 💧

### Why Water Matters

Cats need hydration too! Water works similarly to food but serves a different need.

**How it works:**

- Place water bowls on the page
- Thirsty cats approach
- Cats drink and hydrate
- Water may remain for multiple uses

**When cats drink:**

- When thirsty (different from hunger)
- After eating food
- Periodically for hydration

### Water vs. Food

**Water:**

- For hydration needs
- May last longer
- Complementary to food

**Food:**

- For hunger satisfaction
- Consumed in one interaction
- Primary feeding need

**Best practice:** Provide both food and water for happy cats!

## Cat Responses to Food

### Who Eats First?

Several factors determine which cat reaches food first:

**Distance:**

- Closest cats notice first
- Shorter travel time

**Personality:**

- Curious cats notice faster
- High sociability cats respond more
- Energetic cats move faster

**Current State:**

- Idle cats notice more
- Walking cats may continue their path
- Sitting cats might ignore

**Hunger Level:**

- Hungrier cats prioritize food
- Recently fed cats less interested

### Watching Cats Eat

**What you'll observe:**

1. **Detection**

   - Cat pauses or changes direction
   - Turns toward food

2. **Approach**

   - Walks toward food item
   - May speed up if excited

3. **Consumption**

   - Stops at food location
   - Brief pause
   - Food disappears

4. **Aftermath**
   - Cat may look satisfied
   - Continues exploring
   - Might rest after eating

### Why Cats Ignore Food

Sometimes cats don't respond to food. Here's why:

**Too far away:**

- Beyond detection radius
- Cat focused on other direction

**Not hungry:**

- Recently ate
- Low hunger level

**Personality:**

- Independent cats ignore more
- Low sociability
- Currently focused on something else

**Current state:**

- Deep in play mode
- Committed to another action
- Resting and not active

**Don't worry!** Try:

- Placing food closer
- Waiting a bit
- Using fancy food (more attractive)
- Trying with a different cat

## Feeding Multiple Cats

### Strategy for Many Cats

When there are multiple cats on a page:

**Spread out food:**

- Place items in different locations
- Prevents crowding
- Ensures all cats get a chance

**Use variety:**

- Mix basic and fancy food
- Place water too
- Create multiple feeding spots

**Observe patterns:**

- See which cats approach first
- Notice personality differences
- Adjust placement based on behavior

**Be generous:**

- More cats = more food needed
- Place multiple items at once
- Keep cats well-fed!

### Feeding Stations

Create dedicated areas for feeding:

**Benefits:**

- Cats learn where food appears
- Organized feeding
- Easy to manage

**How to create one:**

1. Pick a spot on the page
2. Consistently place food there
3. Add water nearby
4. Place multiple items for variety

**Tips:**

- Central locations work best
- Near where cats wander
- Open area with space
- Avoid page edges
